# demonator

Typewriter-style text display for terminal demos. Demonator reads a YAML config
file of commands and "types" them out character-by-character with realistic
timing, then executes each command when you press Enter — so live terminal demos
look natural and polished.

## Install

```sh
cargo install demonator
```

Or build from source:

```sh
cargo install --path .
```

## Usage

```sh
demonator              # uses demo.yml in the current directory
demonator -c my.yml    # use a custom config file
demonator --dry-run    # preview demo flow without executing
demonator --watch      # re-run demo when config file changes
```

Press **Enter** after each step to run the command and advance to the next one.

## Quick start

Create `demo.yml`:

```yaml
speed: 20
clear: true
highlight: true

steps:
  - comment: "Let's build the project."
    style: cyan
  - text: "cargo build --release"
  - text: "cargo test"
  - text: "echo 'All done!'"
```

Run it:

```sh
demonator
```
